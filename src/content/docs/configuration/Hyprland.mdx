## What is Hyprland?

Hyprland is a dynamic tiling window manager for Linux which is highly customisable, visually appealing and lightweight. It is a very popular choice for Linux users who like a modern window manager with features like rounded corners, smooth animations and Wayland support.

StratOS Linux offers a Hyprland spin as an option to users trying to venture into the world of Window Managers. The config provided by default is very basic with a few EWW widgets. Users can feel free to customise their Hyprland configs as they see fit by using it as a starting point.
