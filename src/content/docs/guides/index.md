## Installation
StratOS installation is quite simple thanks to our installer. It strives to balance user choice and simplicity.

## Managing software
Users can use the [`rock`](https://github.com/StratOS-Linux/rock) package manager to manage packages efficiently on StratOS.
## Toggling extensions on and off
- Extensions can be toggled in Gnome Settings (search for `Extensions`).
## Using software from other sources (Flatpaks and Snaps)
- `rock` supports flatpak and snap sources.
> **_NOTE_**: The `snap` backend is *<u>not open-source</u>* and hence many users do not like Snaps. Snap apps also take longer to open than standard apps.
