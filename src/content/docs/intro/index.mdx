title: Why StratOS Linux?
description: Introduction to StratOS Linux
---

StratOS is a flexible beginner-friendly Arch Linux distribution focused on providing a stable and modular operating system to users. It combines the performance and bleeding-edge model of Arch Linux with the unique ability of creating a blend of multiple parts of other distros of Bedrock Linux, delivering a system that lets you decide how to work rather than force the user into the confines of a typical Linux distribution.


### Features

#### Rolling Release Architecture

Due to the fact that StratOS is based on Arch Linux, it follows a rolling release architecture. This means that you get continuous access to the latest kernels, drivers and software.

#### Multi-Distro Support

StratOS Linux also comes preinstalled with Bedrock Linux, which allows it to support components, or "stratas" of other distros on top of the existing Arch Linux base. You can fetch stratas of other distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali, Gentoo, Void, etc using the `brl fetch` command.

#### Dedicated Software Repositories

StratOS Linux also comes with its own dedicated software repository out of the box, which includes useful packages like **zen-browser**, **vicinae**, **sherlock launcher**, **pandoc-bin**, etc, which are not available in Arch Linux repositories.
